# C++ Projects Repository

This repository contains my solutions for the C++ programming projects from the 1337's C++ curriculum. The projects cover a wide range of topics and concepts, from basic data types and control structures to advanced object-oriented programming and algorithm design.

## Projects

- **CPP Module00:** Introduction to C++ programming, basic data types, and control structures.
- **CPP Module01:** Memory allocation, references, and pointers.
- **CPP Module02:** Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overload, and canonical classes.
- **CPP Module03:** Inheritance and polymorphism.
- **CPP Module04:** Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.
- **CPP Module05:** Repetitive inheritance, nested classes, and exceptions.
- **CPP Module06:** Type casts, templates, and STL.
- **CPP Module07:** Advanced topics such as smart pointers, lambda expressions, and move semantics.

## Getting Started

To compile and run these projects, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine, such as GCC or Clang. You can compile the source code by running the following command in your terminal:

g++ -Wall -Werror -Wextra -std=c++98 main.cpp


You can then run the compiled executable by running the following command:

make


## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have a bug fix or feature suggestion, please submit a pull request with your changes. However, please note that these projects are intended as learning exercises, and direct copies of solutions are not allowed.
